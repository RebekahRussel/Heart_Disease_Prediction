# Heart_Disease_Prediction
##Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the presence of heart disease in patients. By leveraging a dataset of patient health metrics, various machine learning algorithms are applied to develop models that can accurately predict heart disease. The project explores data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and selection of the best-performing model.

##Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset to ensure it is suitable for machine learning.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the data distributions and relationships between features.
Model Training: Implementing and training multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the models for better performance through techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.
Deployment: Providing code and guidance for deploying the best model for practical use.
##Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease UCI dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes 303 instances with 14 attributes, such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, and more.

##Requirements
Python 3.7+
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
##Results
The results of the model evaluation and comparison are summarized in the notebooks /ML.disease prediction.ipynb notebook. The best-performing model, based on various evaluation metrics, is selected for deployment.
